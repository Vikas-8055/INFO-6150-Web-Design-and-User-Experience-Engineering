        <div class="p1"><p>The Willan Fund (TWF) was established to expand upon Willan Sadler’s exceptional talent for teaching others the work he believed was so important, which he began professionally practicing at the young age of 17. He helped the dogs he worked with and the people he met along the way in equal measure, never interested in accolades, instead preferring to point to his teammate's skills.</p></div>
        <div class="p2"><p>The DPFL family lost Willan to a shallow-water diving accident in July of 2022. It is our duty and our dream to carry his talent and generous spirit forth into the future, providing a hand to those who want to improve shelter dogs’ lives. Our vision for TWF is to cultivate the next generation of shelter caregivers by providing scholarships with an end goal of helping more dogs in honor of Willan and the dogs he loved.</p></div>
