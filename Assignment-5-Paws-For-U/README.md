# Group_14_WD

Our website is dedicated to improving the quality of life for sheltered dogs. We invite everyone to contribute generously through donations or to consider adopting a dog, thereby giving them a better home. Our primary goal is to connect humans with the most loyal and loving companions on this earth. The website has a login page and a home page.


## BOOTSTRAP COMPONENTS
1. ⁠Accordion -  allows you to hide and show sections of related content.For us to render an accordion, we need to add the .open class on the .accordion. In our case, we used this element in the "Frequently Asked Questions" section to drop down the answers to the questions.
2. Alerts - This is used to notify messages or updates. This can be static or dismissable. In our website, it is a dismissable welcome message which we can close if we want to.
3. ⁠Badge - small elements used to display extra information like counts, labels and indicators. We used this element to display the name of the dogs and also their availability.
4. ⁠Button - There are different types of buttons like .btn-primary, .btn-secondary, .btn-success, .btn-danger. There are several buttons that we used in this website to navigate through different sections.
5. ⁠Button Group - This allows us to group multiple buttons together.
6. ⁠Card - This is used to display information in a structured way. We were able to take advantage of this component to display the different dogs with their respective pictures which are up for adoption.
7. ⁠Carousel - It creates a slideshow where you can scroll left or right and navigate through a series of images and content. This component is used in the landing page to swipe left or right.
8. ⁠Close Button - This is used to dismiss alerts or any other information that needs to be closed. In the website, if we click on any pop up, we can close it to navigate the main page again.
9. ⁠Collapse - This allows to make contents appear or dissappear content dynamically without having to refresh the page. This is used internally in an accordion to make it collapsable.
10. Dropdowns - This allows users to select from a list of options. In this website, we used dropdown in the navbar in the section "more" where we can seelct multiple options from the drop down.
11. ⁠Modal - This is a pop up window which appears on top of the page content when hovered over.  In this website, when we click on "adopt me" a pop window appears showing an "adoption request" which is the modal component.
12. Navbar - This is a navigation header that contains links, dropdowns and other navigational information. We included information such as "our mission", "Adopt a dog", "Questions", "Contact us" and "more" in the header using navbar.
13. Offcanvas - This shows the responsiveness of the website. As we decrease the pixel width, the menus slide in from the side of the screen to reveal hidden content.
14. ⁠Pagination - This allows for easy nagivation by breaking the content into different pages. In the website, we can go to the next page, navigate back and forth if we like to.
15. ⁠Popovers - These are like tooltips but can contain more content, including headers and buttons. This component is used in the website and can be seen when we click on "learn more", a small pop up appears with additional information.
16. ⁠Toast - This is the opening notification which pops up as soon as we open the page. The pop up message that appears is "Thank you for visiting PAWSforU! Let us know if you have any questions." in the website after using this component.
