##Features Implemented 


SASS Variables: Implemented in variables.scss, providing a centralized management system for color codes and other constants used across stylesheets.

Interpolation: Applied in _buttons.scss to dynamically generate class names and styles, enhancing the flexibility of the stylesheet.

Mixins :Implemented in mixins.scss, particularly for button styles and centering techniques, allowing for consistency across the design.

Functions : Used in functions.scss for calculating consistent spacing and dimensions, contributing to a harmonious layout throughout the web

Grid Layout :CSS Grid is utilized in the apartment pictures and services sections to ensure a responsive and evenly spaced display of items, implemented in apartment-pictures.scss and services.scss.

Flexbox Layout : Flexbox is employed to align content in the apartment pictures and services sections within a responsive, flexible container that adapts to screen size changes. Items wrap to the next row if there isnâ€™t enough space, ensuring a clean layou
